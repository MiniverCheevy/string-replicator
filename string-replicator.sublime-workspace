			"contents": "Should I start this program over? That probably would've sounded more commanding if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pajamas. Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough. Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted Wind Beneath My Wings for the first dance. Frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. When I kiss you, you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after. You're recently gay! I'm a comfortador also. Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?\nAnd that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion actually was there, it would've been like Woodstock. It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about? You could, uh, could have, like, a world without shrimp, or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. Wash, we've got some local color happening.\nThe human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates. Remember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano? It's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. How about 'cause you're a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu? Easy as really difficult pie. Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Uh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? Oh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. I figure, if I'm responsible for the end of the world, I get to name it. Buffy's boinking Spike.\nSee, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates. I'm not planning on presiding over the end of Western Civilization.\nIt eats you, starting with your bottom. I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community. How did you find me here? We need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. You haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches? Basically, this is what some of your more famous serial killers' brains look like. You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to me.\nI'll kill a man in a fair fight. Or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight. Or if he bothers me. Or if there's a woman. Or if I'm getting paid. Mostly when I'm getting paid. You were a worthless being before you were ever a monster. Basically, this is what some of your more famous serial killers' brains look like. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol. Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug? You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. I don't think Buffy's going to be too broken up over a pylon. Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat. You're a hell of a woman.\nWhat, you think this isn't real just because of all the vampires, and demons, and ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy? Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety-pound girl, 'cause I don't think that's ever getting old.\nWhat did I say to you about barging into my shuttle? The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night. You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Everybody started singing and dancing. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet: I will end you. Instead you go all Dumbledore on me. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are.\nMen watch the action movie, they eat of the beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms. You were a worthless being before you were ever a monster. Shh! No programs, don't use that word. Just be Buffy. Anyway, he seemed to be having a kind of man-reaction. From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual, and a little more fun around here!\nWell, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny. Like, is the hippo going,'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity!' It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about? It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that Sasquatch, we'd be in the dirt right about now, scooping up the Captain's teeth.\nIf the apocalypse comes...beep me! We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to me. It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, 'Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?' You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another.\nSeems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of. Ain't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny? And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!'\nIt's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. The brain is kept in a fear-induced, adrenaline-fueled overdrive state, like a problem you can't solve. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion actually was there, it would've been like Woodstock. Since when do they have orgies, and why aren't I on the mailing list? Recognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own. No, they're something nightmares are from.\nEither blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. Sarcastic? Unfeeling? British?\nIt was supposed to confuse him, but it just made him peppy. This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at talking to girls. It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. Winning over your enemy, the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are, that's real love.\nWhat do they need such good eyesight for anyway? My egg is Jewish. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey? She alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness. You're gonna die screaming but you won't be heard. Recognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own. You can't open the book of my life and jump in the middle. This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it? So, are we gonna sing army songs or something? Scenario: We raise Buffy from the grave. She tries to eat our brains.\nYour futures are murky; you'd do well to heed my...I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? Let me pour you a big frosty mug of 'shut-the-hell-up.' My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness. What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? Special isn't always a good thing here, Boyd. We will rule over all this land, and we will call it...This Land. Better to cut you down to size, grandma. Bonnie and Clyde, they wanted fame, notoriety, and boy did they get it. They also got dead. And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!'\nThis distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it? But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal. The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. Anything for you, because I love you. Deep, deep man love. No, Angel, it's not you. How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious.\nAnd that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness. You are talking crazy-person talk. Put your words in word places please. Oh my god! Did it sing?\nWash, we've got some local color happening. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy. Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us? It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!\nLittle man loved fire. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. Can't call to mom, can't say a word. I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons. I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. How did you find me here? It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to. We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime.\nMilitary people don't make out with science people. Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted Wind Beneath My Wings for the first dance. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present while you were unconscious, from the ice. Planet's coming up a mite fast.\nAnd what's with all the carrots? They need to take seven and they might take yours. My egg is Jewish. Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap. You're recently gay! So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? Can't even shout, can't even cry. We live in a space ship, dear.\nLove keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down. I like to think of myself more as a 'guest-age'. Stay away from hyena people, or any loser athletes, or if you see anyone who's invisible. Time for some thrilling heroics.\nSo we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. If you say 'adorabubble,' I'm leaving. Bonnie and Clyde, they wanted fame, notoriety, and boy did they get it. They also got dead. No, Angel, it's not you. You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. He'll be an empty-headed robot wondering around Hollywood; he'll be fine! Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat.\nYou haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches? Looking in windows, knocking on doors. Don't strain your brain trying, then. Might break something. I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move. They are come to the killing floor. Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? And now the one person who should be here is gone, and a waste like you gets to live.\nRecognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own. Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy. Welcome to the nancy tribe. Freedom is life's great lie. Uh, thermal exhaust port's above the main port, numbnuts. Just once I would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers. I told him that I loved him, I kissed him, and I killed him. From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual, and a little more fun around here! It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? Sarcastic? Unfeeling? British?\nWe need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel. Now I'm just a big, fluffy puppy with bad teeth. This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at talking to girls. Like, is the hippo going,'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity!' I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts. I find it a bit sad that you think of yourself as a candidate for anyone's fantasy. Yeah, it was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists. First of all, Feng Shui up the yin yang, also I designed parts of it but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes and the ample massage facilities. Wash, we've got some local color happening.\nYou're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you? Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire.\nWe're outlaws with hearts of gold. Buffy's boinking Spike. I'll kill a man in a fair fight. Or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight. Or if he bothers me. Or if there's a woman. Or if I'm getting paid. Mostly when I'm getting paid. Oh Spike, devour me! Xander, that's not the North Star, it's an airplane. You are talking crazy-person talk. Put your words in word places please. We're pimps and killers, but in a philanthropic way. It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? We live in a space ship, dear.\nShe alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness. My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night. So, she's added cussing and hurling about of things to her repertoire. Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. Oh Spike, devour me!\nWhat gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? Easy as really difficult pie.\nTime is what turns kittens into cats. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. Or even worse, a sneezure. You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie.\nEither blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me. Uh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that Sasquatch, we'd be in the dirt right about now, scooping up the Captain's teeth. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. I don't want to use the word genius, but I'd be ok if you wanted to.\nMy entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? You could, uh, could have, like, a world without shrimp, or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. I'm a comfortador also.\nThey've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. Oh my god! Did it sing?\nStart with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety-pound girl, 'cause I don't think that's ever getting old. I suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression. Time is what turns kittens into cats. Little man loved fire. Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes.\nWell, I'm sure I'm in serious need of some moral spankitude, but guess who's not qualified to be my Rabbi? It was the pioneer days; people had to make their own interrogation rooms. Out of cornmeal. They rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his soul. Wash, we've got some local color happening.\nNobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness. Seems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. How did you find me here? The lambs have passed through the gate. The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. You sanguine about the kind of reception we're apt to receive on an Alliance ship, Cap'n? Anyone in this much pain prays, or at least curses. If you can't do something smart, do something right.\nEvery single person down there is ignoring your pain because they're too busy with their own. Imagine Bonnie and Clyde if they had 150 years to get it right. They need to take seven and they might take yours. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol. Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. You could, uh, could have, like, a world without shrimp, or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. Should I start this program over? I've seen the best and the worst of you.\nThe lambs have passed through the gate. I mean, don't get me wrong, I heart my porn, but this is cool! And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. Can everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on? They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. Big damn heroes, sir.\nRemember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano? Woman, you are completely off your nut. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol.\nI'll never leave. Not even if you kill me. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. I suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression. Sarcastic? Unfeeling? British? See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. You were a worthless being before you were ever a monster. We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. Or even worse, a sneezure. What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? And what's with all the carrots?\nNo, Angel, it's not you. I mean, officially I deplore violence, but that was totally worth the loss of karma points! Turns out I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse. I brought you some supper but if you'd prefer a lecture, I've a few very catchy ones prepped: sin and hellfire, one has lepers.\nYou can't take the sky from me. Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today. Seems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of. What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle? Say Skywalker, and I smack ya. Welcome to the future, where cars fly, robots serve our every whim, and genetically engineered dinosaurs rule the Earth. I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me.\nBetter to cut you down to size, grandma. See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. Time is what turns kittens into cats. I love what you are, what you do, how you try.\nFrankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. No, they're something nightmares are from.\nSo we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. Turns out I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse. One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. She is the slayer. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. Like, is the hippo going,'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity!' Let me pour you a big frosty mug of 'shut-the-hell-up.' The gentlemen are coming by.\nAnd I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. Bunnies! Bunnies! It must be Bunnies! We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode. Time is what turns kittens into cats. Okay, uh, I'm lost. I'm angry. And I'm armed. In every generation there is a chosen one. Darn your sinister attraction! It's about women.\nWe're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode. He'll be an empty-headed robot wondering around Hollywood; he'll be fine! I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present while you were unconscious, from the ice. The lambs have passed through the gate. You could, uh, could have, like, a world without shrimp, or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted.\nA vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic, in a maudlin sort of way. We live in a space ship, dear.\nI, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? Occasionally, I'm callous and strange. What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? Somebody put her tiny little thinking cap on! Special isn't always a good thing here, Boyd. Easy as really difficult pie. My egg is Jewish.\nEveryone's a hero in their own way, in their own not that heroic way. How did you find me here? Buffy's boinking Spike. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present while you were unconscious, from the ice. I don't buckle. Occasionally I swashbuckle. Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet. Occasionally, I'm callous and strange. Well, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny. You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness.\nOccasionally, I'm callous and strange. You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! It's about women. Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt. I don't buckle. Occasionally I swashbuckle.\nI suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present while you were unconscious, from the ice. Uh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? No, they're something nightmares are from. Somebody put her tiny little thinking cap on! Stay with me. Forever. That's the whole point. They need to take seven and they might take yours. We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode.\nThe news isn't there to tell you what happened. It's there to tell you what it wants you to hear or what it thinks you want to hear. Ain't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny? No, Angel, it's not you. Shh! No programs, don't use that word. Just be Buffy. No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me. If the apocalypse comes...beep me! Easy as really difficult pie.\nLove keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down. The lambs have passed through the gate. You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Can everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on?\nYou can't open the book of my life and jump in the middle. Oh my god! Did it sing? It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about? First of all, Feng Shui up the yin yang, also I designed parts of it but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes and the ample massage facilities. Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety-pound girl, 'cause I don't think that's ever getting old. For this plan to work, River and I will have to be dead. I've seen the best and the worst of you. They've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses.\nYou're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat. He'll be an empty-headed robot wondering around Hollywood; he'll be fine! We're pimps and killers, but in a philanthropic way. She came from the grave much graver. No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again?\nUh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. With any luck, he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates. The only thing Willow was ever good for, the only thing I ever had going for me were those moments, just moments, where Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. Darn your sinister attraction! Oh my god! Did it sing?\nThese are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me. Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us? What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey? I love what you are, what you do, how you try. You can't take the sky from me.\nSo, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? I've got a theory, some kid is dreaming, and we're all stuck inside his wacky broadway nightmare. We're outlaws with hearts of gold.\nCan't even shout, can't even cry. Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness. I like to think of myself more as a 'guest-age'. Freedom is life's great lie. Xander, that's not the North Star, it's an airplane. I'm not planning on presiding over the end of Western Civilization. She came from the grave much graver.\nI'm a rogue demon hunter now. Little man loved fire. Okay, uh, I'm lost. I'm angry. And I'm armed. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. Your futures are murky; you'd do well to heed my...I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? Everybody started singing and dancing. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet: I will end you. Uh, thermal exhaust port's above the main port, numbnuts. Freedom is life's great lie.\nIf you can't do something smart, do something right. It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. They rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his soul. Instead you go all Dumbledore on me. Better to cut you down to size, grandma.\nFreedom is life's great lie. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug? You'll prove I can trust you when the day comes that you have to kill me. And you do. You haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches? Remember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano? Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. Apocalypse, we've all been there; the same old trips, why should we care?\nI gave birth to a pterodactyl. Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap. She's a truck-driving magic mama! Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm. Risk the pain, it is your nature. Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire. I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. Stay away from hyena people, or any loser athletes, or if you see anyone who's invisible. Planet's coming up a mite fast.\nImagine Bonnie and Clyde if they had 150 years to get it right. It was the pioneer days; people had to make their own interrogation rooms. Out of cornmeal. Oh my god! Did it sing? You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. Wash, we've got some local color happening. You can't take the sky from me. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me.\nSomebody put her tiny little thinking cap on! Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire.\nI recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. In the time of gods and monsters, what is the worth of a man? When I say, 'I love you,' it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to me. Well, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment. Bunnies! Bunnies! It must be Bunnies!\nI suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression. You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy. Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. She's a witch. Special isn't always a good thing here, Boyd. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at talking to girls. Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat.\nWell, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment. First of all, Feng Shui up the yin yang, also I designed parts of it but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes and the ample massage facilities. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. From beneath you, it devours. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me.\nI brought you some supper but if you'd prefer a lecture, I've a few very catchy ones prepped: sin and hellfire, one has lepers. Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey?\nThey rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his soul. I don't think Buffy's going to be too broken up over a pylon. It has nothing to do with me. Everyone's a hero in their own way, in their own not that heroic way. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.\nWe need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel. I find it a bit sad that you think of yourself as a candidate for anyone's fantasy.\nOh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life was when you were dead. Little man loved fire. I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move. I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. I am never gonna see a merman, ever.\nRemember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano? I gave birth to a pterodactyl. She is the slayer. I'm a rogue demon hunter now. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates. I knew you were lying. Undead liar guy.\nSomebody put her tiny little thinking cap on! Occasionally, I'm callous and strange. My egg is Jewish. Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.\nSee, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual, and a little more fun around here! Anyone in this much pain prays, or at least curses. It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? They're a little bit bison. It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!\nFrankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. Welcome to the future, where cars fly, robots serve our every whim, and genetically engineered dinosaurs rule the Earth. They've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. Say Skywalker, and I smack ya. Well, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment.\nWho's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Why not default them with ninja skills or whatever? They've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. Now I'm just a big, fluffy puppy with bad teeth. Yeah, it was sexy the way she touched me real hard with her fists. This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at talking to girls. Remember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano?\nUh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that? Why not default them with ninja skills or whatever? Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today. How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. Can everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on? So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? So I skipped intro to evil or whatever, but how is it that I get an F, when this guy that we're reading, Chauncey, can't even spell?\nOnce again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap. It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to. If you say 'adorabubble,' I'm leaving. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol.\nI dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal. Woman, you are completely off your nut. Freedom is life's great lie. You will keep a civil tongue in this house or we'll put your tongue in a stew. My egg is Jewish. Recognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own. I've seen your kindness and your strength. You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. Sarcastic? Unfeeling? British?\nHe'll be an empty-headed robot wondering around Hollywood; he'll be fine! From beneath you, it devours. They rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his soul. You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes! That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. Turns out I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse.\nA whole mess of sparrows turning on a dime, salmon trucking upstream. Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today.\nThey've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. So, are we gonna sing army songs or something? Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. Freedom is life's great lie.\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I heart my porn, but this is cool! Okay, uh, I'm lost. I'm angry. And I'm armed. Time for some thrilling heroics. Scenario: We raise Buffy from the grave. She tries to eat our brains. And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!' Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots. Imagine Bonnie and Clyde if they had 150 years to get it right. These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me. I find it a bit sad that you think of yourself as a candidate for anyone's fantasy. Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.\nOh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. Buffy's boinking Spike. Basically, this is what some of your more famous serial killers' brains look like. You sanguine about the kind of reception we're apt to receive on an Alliance ship, Cap'n? Men, with your sales. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. It's a real burn, being right so often. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol. Oh my god! Did it sing?\nEyeballs to entrails, my sweet. The only thing Willow was ever good for, the only thing I ever had going for me were those moments, just moments, where Tara would look at me and I was wonderful.\nI don't buckle. Occasionally I swashbuckle. And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!' Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet: I will end you. I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body! First of all, Feng Shui up the yin yang, also I designed parts of it but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes and the ample massage facilities.\nAnd I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. It's a real burn, being right so often. We're pimps and killers, but in a philanthropic way. We live in a space ship, dear. Anyone in this much pain prays, or at least curses. Anyway, he seemed to be having a kind of man-reaction.\nWhy can't you just masturbate like the rest of us? So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.\nPlanet's coming up a mite fast. See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape.\nThe only time you were ever at peace in your whole life was when you were dead. And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!' I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats. Freedom is life's great lie. You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes!\nI'm not planning on presiding over the end of Western Civilization. Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today. If you say 'adorabubble,' I'm leaving. If you can't do something smart, do something right. I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose? Anything for you, because I love you. Deep, deep man love. I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move. But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal.\nSay, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug? See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. I told him that I loved him, I kissed him, and I killed him. No, Angel, it's not you. That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey? Time is what turns kittens into cats. Your futures are murky; you'd do well to heed my...I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that Sasquatch, we'd be in the dirt right about now, scooping up the Captain's teeth.\nOh Spike, devour me! That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. You're recently gay!\nCan everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on? She is the slayer. It's a real burn, being right so often. From beneath you, it devours. I don't want to use the word genius, but I'd be ok if you wanted to. Like, is the hippo going,'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity!' Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. The gentlemen are coming by.\n<!-- please do not remove this line -->\n\n<div style='display:none;'>\n<a href='http://www.commercekitchen.com'>ipsum generator</a>\n</div>\n\n<!-- end whedon ipsum code -->",
